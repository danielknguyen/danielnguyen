            As a software engineer, I naturally took on demos, training,
            onboarding, and even helped close deals.

          <li className="fragment">
            I loved bridging the gap between customers and product — making tech
            feel approachable.
          </li>
          <li className="fragment">
            Sales engineering lets me focus on that impact, not just the code.
          </li>
          <li className="fragment">
            It’s the perfect blend of my technical background and communication
            strengths.
